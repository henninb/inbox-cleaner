  # New commands I could add:
  - `cleanup-filters`: Remove duplicates and optimize existing filters
  - `export-filters`: Export filters to XML for backup/restore
  - `import-filters`: Import optimized filter configurations
  - `analyze-filters`: Show filter efficiency and overlap analysis

  3. Smart Filter Prioritization

  - Performance ordering: Reorder filters to put most-hit filters first
  - Efficiency analysis: Identify slow/complex filters and suggest improvements
  - Usage tracking: Monitor which filters are actually being used

  4. Advanced Filter Actions

  - Multi-action filters: Combine delete + unsubscribe + block in single filters
  - Conditional logic: Create filters that apply different actions based on context
  - Time-based filters: Filters that activate/deactivate based on schedules

  5. Filter Health Monitoring

  - Broken filter detection: Find filters targeting deleted labels
  - Performance metrics: Track filter hit rates and processing times
  - Maintenance alerts: Notify when filters need updates

  6. Bulk Operations

  - Parallel filter creation: Create multiple filters simultaneously with rate limiting
  - Transaction-like operations: All-or-nothing filter updates
  - Rollback capability: Undo filter changes if issues arise



    - Merge similar filters: Combine multiple domain filters using wildcards (e.g., *@spam*.com instead of separate filters)
  - Pattern optimization: Use more efficient regex patterns in filter criteria
  - Remove redundant filters: Automatically detect and remove filters that are superseded by broader rules
